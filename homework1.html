    <br>The picture to the left is my Big Mac Index from 2020 showing the Purchasing Power Parity (not the exchange rate) of how much it costs to buy a Big Mac in different coutnries. The poster behind me is the 2011 xkcd Money poster of how much things cost, from dollars to thousands to millions to billions to trillions.
